# alfresco-jlan-with-version
Based on alfresco-jlan-source_5_0_0. 

Alfresco-jlan-source_5_0_0 works fine, but it doesn't support file version control., AND This one is one for that.

It's very hard for us to make it, but finally, after lots of hard working during nearly one year, it works almostly now!
